				<h3>Human Story Theatre</h3>
				<p>Human Story Theatre focusses	on new plays with health and social issues at heart. Their plays 'pop-up' in any designated space.  'Lizzie on the Fence' is a new black comedy about lockdown love. Lizzie is forbidden to see Bill in his care home, but she finds a way. Images taken during staged reading rehearsal.</p>
