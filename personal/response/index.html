          <h3>Response to Transition</h3>
			<p>The community side of this project  is described in more detail below.<br />
          I initiated this project because of  my experience of watching my brother move from life towards death due to  illness. My images were a visual poem about my grieving process;
          the whole project was dedicated to  his memory.Â  Here are 6 of 25 images which were  exhibited as a visual poem.</p>

        <p>Together with artists, <a href="../../links/index.html">Claire Christie Sadler</a> and <a href="../../links/index.html">Wren Hughes</a>,  we created a project which involved community members an<img src="../../images/logos.gif" alt="Arts Council England, Fusion and Oxford City Council logos" width="224" height="58" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" />d ourselves responding to  the theme of &#8216;transition&#8217;. We ran art workshops during November and December 2007.
      June 10-28 we had an Exhibition at <strong><a href="../../links/index.html">The North Wall Gallery</a></strong>, South Parade, Oxford, showing photography, installations, sculpture and drawings.  This project was funded by the <a href="../../links/index.html">Arts Council</a>, England and <a href="../../links/index.html">Oxford City Council</a> and was supported by <a href="../../links/index.html">FUSION</a> an Oxford Community Arts Agency. My personal work has since been re-exhibited , West Oxfordshire Arts,  Bampton Gallery July 2009.</p>
