          <p><img src="../../images/ecco-logo-black-white.png" height="51" alt="Supported by Ecco Oxford"  class="alignright" />In recognition of the individual who feels 'out of reach' and isolated yet longs to find a reality where potential strengths and self-worth are acknowledged and encouraged. This struggle to come 'within reach' is explored metaphorically through drawings (Claire),  photographs and words (Judie).<br />
            Inspired by community and personal experiences.<br />
