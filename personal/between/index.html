      <h3>Between Spaces</h3>
			<p>Together with artist Claire Christie Sadler we held an exhibition at West Ox Arts, Bampton, November 2011.  <br>
     I tried to capture images that showed places, people and things whose existence may be transient, unpredictable, strange or mysterious-floating and held in those spaces between. <br>
     Claire's focus in her drawings was the place between two spaces-an edge, a boundary, a defining line and the relationship between the two areas it divides. </p>
