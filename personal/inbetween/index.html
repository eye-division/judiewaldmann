      <h3>In-between Spaces</h3>
      <p>A study of memory loss in people with early onset dementia. A year and a half collaboration with two local Oxfordshire support groups, <a href="../../links/index.html">The Clive Project</a> (now known as Young Dementia UK) and <a href="../../links/index.html">SPECAL</a>. Some Clive Project members chose to take their own photographs and / or tell their story through images, words and video. The former expressions were made into a book, an essential part of an Exhibition which took place in May 2006 at the Jacqueline du Pr&eacute; Music Building, Oxford.</p>
