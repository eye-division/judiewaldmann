        <h3>St Michael&rsquo;s and All Angels Church, Oxford (2009)</h3>
    <p>We  were commissioned by the Church to encourage local school children and community to make one hundred &lsquo;flying&rsquo; angels to celebrate the Church&rsquo;s  centenary.  The installation of over 150 angels, was part of 2009 Oxford City Artweeks and remained in situ for much of 2009.</p>
