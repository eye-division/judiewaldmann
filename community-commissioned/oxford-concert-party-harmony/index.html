            <h3>Oxford Concert Party's Harmony Project</h3>
             <p>Oxford Concert Party, led by Isabel Knowland and Arne Richards, invited people to take part in The Harmony Project. Joined by other Artists many individuals made and decorated globes, sang, danced, listened to music and stories and together celebrated our diversity in our shared world. St Michaels and All Angels Church in Oxford was the main base for activities but several other events took place in a variety of local venues.</p>
