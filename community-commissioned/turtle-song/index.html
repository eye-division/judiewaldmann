			<h3>Turtle Song</h3>
        <p>Turtle Song, produced and devised by Turtle Key Arts, brings music, song making, movement and singing to people with all forms of dementia together with their companions and carers. In 2017 they did 8 weekly meetings with Young Dementia UK in Oxford. Carolyn and Jon led the sessions with help from student musicians.</p>
