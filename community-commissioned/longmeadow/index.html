        <h3>Creative Partnerships with Longmeadow School, Milton Keynes (2008)</h3>
    		<p>I was commissioned to explore, with staff and pupils from year 5, the  value of using photography as a means of recording scientific experiments.<br />
      	Photography helped their scientific learning, aided their ability to  work in small groups, enhanced independent decision - making, and was a  particularly successful way to involve learners with special needs. <br />
    	The children created a permanent gallery of images some of which are shown here.</p>
