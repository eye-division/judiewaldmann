        <h3>ITHACA (2007)</h3>
        <p> commisioned me as both a visiting artist to work in Day Centres with elderly people and to document the work of other artists involved in their SAGE programme. <strong><br />
      The images shown were taken by people who attended a day centre in Wantage, Oxfordshire</strong> and came to 8 weekly meetings to learn more about photography and music as a means of personal expression, Oct-Dec 07.</p>
