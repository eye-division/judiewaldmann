        <h3>Seesaw</h3>
        <p>An Oxfordshire Support group for grieving children and their families, helping them to move forward to face the future with hope.</p>
        <p>Seesaw commissioned me to help young people to explore the use of photography, composition and lighting to express some of the feelings they have experienced during their bereavement.</p>
