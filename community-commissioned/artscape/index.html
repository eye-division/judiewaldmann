        <h3>Artscape (2009-2015)</h3>
  <p>This organisation provides a wide range of creative projects, for the benefit of people who use the services of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust. The images are a sample of teenagers work during a range of projects that explored feelings, places, and spaces created and lost. The new Highfield Unit, Warnford Hospital (opened Autumn 2012)  adopted 20 of their images to hang in a variety of their rooms. (Example images 1.2.3)</p>
