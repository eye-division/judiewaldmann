			<h3>Waving Hello (2017)</h3>
        <p>Waving Hello 2017 was a community project led by Oxford Concert Party â€“see my music page. The project lasted several months and celebrated diversity and common humanity. Primary school children learnt about the lives and journeys of refugees and asylum seekers through history, objects, music, dance, singing, visual arts, story telling and listening to the experiences of real refugees.<br>
			In June 2017 a huge public event took place in Bonn Square, Oxford where a temporary installation of over 2000 paper boats were laid on the ground symbolizing the treacherous journeys of many to find safety.</p>
